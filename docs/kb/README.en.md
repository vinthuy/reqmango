# Knowledge Base

The KB is the **single source of truth** for the reqmango system, always describing the current actual state.

**Last Updated**: 2026-10-25

## Maintenance Principles

- **Timeliness**: when a feature ships, the corresponding KB document is updated in the same change
- **Accuracy**: the KB describes what the code actually does, not what was intended at design time
- **Conciseness**: the KB is a reference, not a development log. Keep the core, drop the procedure

## KB Update Triggers

| Event | Update scope |
|-------|--------------|
| New feature completed | `architecture/README.md` module table + `data-model.md` tables + `frontend.md` |
| API changes | `api-conventions.md` |
| Data model changes | `data-model.md` |
| Tech stack upgrade | `tech-stack.md` + `architecture/README.md` |
