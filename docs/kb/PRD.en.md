## 1. Product Overview

reqmango is a modern project management platform: manage projects, work items, cycles, and documents inside a workspace; adapt the platform to a team's process with **customizable types / fields / workflows / automation**; and keep AI embedded in the PM path to help with triage, analysis, and rule drafts — not as a separate agent operations console.

### 1.0 Product direction (2026-09)

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Issue / Cycle / Module / Pages / Dashboard | Start new productization of Harness · Loop · multi-agent pipelines |
| **Custom issue types, custom fields, custom workflows, automation rules** (acceptance gate) | Expose the `/agents/*` console by default (requires `rm_advanced_agents=1`) |
| Intake triage, issue/project Analyze, NL→automation preview, `ai_summary` widget | Schedule a standalone Agent platform ("Agent as Teammates / full SDLC") |

Authoritative design: [AI PM redesign](https://github.com/vinthuy/reqmango/blob/master/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-25-ai-project-management-redesign.md) · Acceptance: [product-core-qa](https://github.com/vinthuy/reqmango/blob/master/docs/dev/acceptance/2026-09-25-product-core-qa.md)

### 1.1 Core values

- **A unified work hub**: projects, work items, documents, and collaboration in one platform
- **A configurable process core**: types, fields, state workflows, and automation rules are first-class capabilities
- **AI embedded in the workflow**: triage, analysis, rule drafts, dashboard summaries — with a preview before anything is written
- **Seamless integration**: GitHub / Slack and friends (as actually shipped)

### 1.2 Target users

Software, product, and cross-functional teams that deliver collaboratively — admins configure the process, members move work items forward.

| Role permissions | Admin / Member / Guest, three levels | Settings → Role management |
| Workspace switch | Quick switch between workspaces | Workspace name → Select |
| Delete workspace | Permanent deletion (Admin required) | Settings → General → Delete workspace |

### 3.3 Member roles

| Role | Permission scope | Typical user |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| Admin | Full control | Team lead, project manager |

```

---

## 19. Audit and compliance

### 19.1 Overview

Work-item changes are stored on `issue_activities`. There is no separate compliance checklist, compliance archive, or audit export.

### 19.2 What is recorded

| Record | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Work-item activity** | `issue_activities` stores changes on a work item |
| **Access** | People who can see the work item can see that activity |

---

## 20. Enterprise authentication

### 20.1 Overview

Sign-in is email and password. The server issues a JWT. Long-lived calls use a personal access token with the prefix `reqmango_pat_`; only the SHA-256 hash is stored.

There is no SSO, SAML, OIDC, or LDAP.

### 20.2 Methods

| Method | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Password** | Stored as a bcrypt hash |
| **JWT** | `Authorization: Bearer`. Login returns `access_token`, `token_type`, and `expires_at` |
| **Personal access token** | Same Bearer header, recognized before JWT |

---

## 21. User interface design

### 21.1 Design principles

- **Clear and direct**: important information at a glance
- **Efficient**: fewer clicks, keyboard shortcuts
- **Consistent**: one visual language and interaction model
- **Responsive**: desktop, tablet, mobile

### 21.2 Colour scheme

| Purpose | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Primary | #6366F1 | Indigo, for primary buttons and emphasis |
| Secondary | #8B5CF6 | Violet, for AI-related surfaces |
| Success | #10B981 | Green, completed states |
| Warning | #F59E0B | Orange, pending items |
| Error | #EF4444 | Red, errors or urgency |
| Background | #FFFFFF / #F9FAFB | White / light grey |
| Text | #111827 / #6B7280 | Dark grey / mid grey |

### 21.3 Layout

| Region | Content |
|--------|---------|
| Sidebar | Workspace, project, cycle, module, page navigation |
| Top bar | Search, AI assistant, notifications, user menu |
| Main area | Work item list, board, detail pages |
| Right panel | Work item detail, comments (collapsible) |

---

## 22. Technical architecture

### 22.1 System architecture

The runtime is one Go process and a Vue frontend. There is no separate gateway, auth service, Redis, or object store. Attachments are written to a local directory.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Web[Vue web app] --> API[Gin HTTP API]
    API --> Auth[JWT or PAT middleware]
    Auth --> Handlers[Workspace, project, work item, cycle, module, page, AI, webhook]
    Handlers --> DB[(PostgreSQL)]
    Handlers --> Files[Local attachment directory]
    Handlers --> LLM[LLM API]
    Handlers --> GitHub[GitHub]
    Handlers --> Slack[Slack]
```

### 22.2 Technology choices

The project uses **Vue 3 + Go + Gin + GORM**.

| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Frontend framework | Vue 3 + Composition API | Component-based, reactive |
| Build tool | Vite | Fast development loop |
| Styling | TailwindCSS | Utility-first CSS |
| State management | Pinia | The Vue 3 default |
| Frontend types | TypeScript | Type safety |
| Backend framework | Go + Gin 1.x | High-performance HTTP |
| Validation | Gin ShouldBindJSON | Request binding and validation |
| ORM | GORM 2.x | Go ORM |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16+ | Relational store |
| Authentication | JWT (golang-jwt/v5) or a personal access token | The same Bearer header |
| File storage | Local filesystem | Attachment uploads |
| AI integration | DeepSeek / Anthropic / OpenAI | LLM support (SSE streaming) |
| Query language | RQL (custom) | Advanced work item search |

### 22.3 Database model (core entities)

Primary keys are autoincrement `uint64`, not UUIDs. The diagram below is only the main path. All 131 tables are in [data-model.md](architecture/data-model.md).

```mermaid
erDiagram

        bigint project_id FK
        string name
        date start_date
        date end_date
    }

    MODULE {
        bigint id PK
        bigint project_id FK
        string name
    }

    PAGE {

## 24. Implementation status (summary)

The main path, AI PM (P1–2 + B1–C2), and native PM acceptance (including the core-customization gate) are **complete**.
The detailed phase tables and schema lists are historical planning and no longer drive scheduling; code and acceptance documents are authoritative.

| Milestone | Status | Documentation |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Native PM main path | ✅ PASS | [product-core-qa](https://github.com/vinthuy/reqmango/blob/master/docs/dev/acceptance/2026-09-25-product-core-qa.md) |
| AI PM native AI project-management path | ✅ PASS | [redesign](https://github.com/vinthuy/reqmango/blob/master/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-25-ai-project-management-redesign.md) |
| Agent platform productization | ❌ Retired | [superseded/agent-platform](https://github.com/vinthuy/reqmango/blob/master/docs/superseded/agent-platform/README.md) |
| Next stage | Existing-product quality | No new large AI features |
